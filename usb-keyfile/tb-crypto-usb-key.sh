# Updated by Rodolfo Garcia (kix) <kix at kix dot com>
# For multiple partitions

#
# Updated by TJ <linux@tjworld.net> 7 July 2008
# For use with Ubuntu Hardy, usplash, automatic detection of USB devices,
# detection and examination of *all* partitions on the device (not just partition #1),
# automatic detection of partition type, refactored, commented, debugging code.
#
# Updated by Hendrik van Antwerpen <hendrik at van-antwerpen dot net> 3 Sept 2008
# For encrypted key device support, also added stty support for not
# showing your password in console mode.
#
# Updated by Jan-Pascal van Best janpascal/at/vanbest/org 2009-12-07
# to support latest debian updates (vol_id missing, blkid used instead)
#
# Updated by Renaud Metrich renaud.metrich/at/laposte/net 2011-09-24
# to support Ubuntu 10.04 and onward.
# Explanation of the patch:
# The issue reported later against USB was due to the fact that devices in  
# /sys/block/*/device point to a relative path on Ubuntu instead of full  
# path name. The solution was to cd to that directory and issue a pwd.
# Also, I improved a bit the algorithm to speed up things, typically by  
# first checking whether the device (e.g. sdb) was a USB and removable  
# stuff, instead of doing the same test on every single partition of the  
# device (e.g. sdb1, sdb2, ...).

# Updated by dgb for plymouth support in Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS
#
# Updated by Travis Burtrum <admin@moparisthebest.com> 2013-01-24
# * Merged in MMC support originally by Cromwel Flores <cromwel dot flores at gmail dot com>
#   now the same script works with USB or MMC devices if they exist with complete code reuse.
# * Modified to loop while trying to detect USB/MMC devices, sleeping for only one
#   second at a time, in case they are ready earlier than expected, instead of just
#   sleeping for X seconds (previously 7) and trying once.  Significant speedup.
# * Fixed a bug where after finding the key on one device, it would continue looping
#   through the rest of the devices.  Now it breaks out earlier.
# * Changed a few minor cosmetic things, moved some global variables people might need
#   to modify up top, and changed script output to match exactly the standard cryptsetup
#   text as of Ubuntu 12.04
